# Enterprise CPQ — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Enterprise CPQ is an open-source, self-hosted **Configure, Price, Quote** platform built for enterprise
healthcare SaaS companies with complex product catalogs and multi-variable pricing models. It enables
Sales Representatives to build accurate, multi-product quotes with real-time financial calculations while
giving Sales Operations complete control over the product catalog, pricing rules, and system settings.

The platform is designed as a **white-label system** — any organization can configure their own company
name, logo, brand colors, and product catalog through an admin settings panel without touching source code.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Enterprise healthcare sales teams manage pricing that is too complex for spreadsheets: tiered PMPM pricing,
multi-product bundles with parent/child dependencies, volume inheritance, multi-year contracts with annual
escalators, one-time implementation fees, and T&M services must all coexist in a single accurate quote.
Existing generic CPQ tools are expensive, require heavy customization, and don't model the healthcare payer
pricing patterns (PMPM, membership-based volume tiers) that this market requires.

This application closes that gap with a purpose-built, open-source tool that any team can deploy, brand,
and extend.

## 7. Feature Requirements

### Phase 1 — Core CPQ Platform

**Goal:** A fully functional quoting platform with auth, product catalog management, quote building,
and real-time financial calculations.

---

#### 7.1 Authentication & Authorization

- **FR-AUTH-1:** Email + password registration and login. Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes.
- **FR-AUTH-2:** JWT-based sessions — short-lived access token (15 min) + refresh token (7 days),
  both stored as `httpOnly` cookies.
- **FR-AUTH-3:** Salesforce OAuth 2.0 login. On first login via Salesforce, a CPQ user record is
  created with `role: 'sales_rep'`; a Super Admin can elevate the role.
- **FR-AUTH-4:** All API routes require a valid JWT. Role-based middleware enforces permissions per route.
- **FR-AUTH-5:** Password reset via email (SMTP config via env vars).
- **FR-AUTH-6:** Account deactivation — deactivated users cannot log in; their historical quotes are preserved.

---

#### 7.2 Company Branding & Settings

- **FR-BRAND-1:** A Super Admin settings page to configure: Company Name and Logo (file upload).
- **FR-BRAND-2:** The application uses Bootstrap 5 default colors throughout; brand color
  customization is not supported. Company Name and Logo are the only configurable brand identity fields.
- **FR-BRAND-3:** Default state is a neutral "Enterprise CPQ" identity with a placeholder logo until configured.

---

#### 7.3 Product Line Management

- **FR-LINE-1:** Product Lines are admin-configurable — created, renamed, reordered, and deleted via a settings panel.
- **FR-LINE-2:** Each Product Line has a Name and an optional color/badge for display purposes.
- **FR-LINE-3:** Deleting a Product Line is blocked if any products are currently assigned to it.

---

#### 7.4 Product Catalog Management

- **FR-PROD-1:** Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) products via an Admin product catalog page.
  Only Admins may write; all authenticated users may read.
- **FR-PROD-2:** Product fields:

| Field                          | Type                                          | Description                                                                                                             |

| Billing Type                   | Enum                                          | `One-Time`, `Recurring (Monthly)`, `Usage / Transactional`, `Time & Materials`                                          |
| Base Price                     | Number                                        | Price used when strategy is Standard                                                                                    |
| Unit Cost                      | Number                                        | Internal COGS for margin calculations                                                                                   |
| Implementation Fee             | Number                                        | One-time setup fee                                                                                                      |
| Overage Price                  | Number                                        | Per-unit cost if a usage allowance is exceeded                                                                          |
| Is Baseline Product            | Boolean                                       | If true, this product's fee is applied **once per quote** when any product in the same line is selected — never stacked |
| Is Quantity Based              | Boolean                                       | True = price driven by units entered; False = price driven by membership count                                          |
| Inherit Tier Volumes From Core | Boolean                                       | Child products use the parent Core's tier/band index for pricing                                                        |

| Volume Bands                   | Array `{label, maxMembers, price, implPrice}` | Used when strategy is `Volume Bands`; final band has no upper bound (e.g. 250,001+)                                     |
| Scope-Based Pricing            | Enum                                          | `None` / `All` (all pricing TBD) / `Implementation Only` (impl TBD; PMPM/monthly costs display normally)                |

- **FR-PROD-3:** Filter catalog view by Product Line. Search by name or SKU.
- **FR-PROD-4:** XLSX export — exports the full catalog with all fields, resolving IDs to names for human
  readability, and encoding tiers/bands as human-readable strings.
- **FR-PROD-5:** XLSX import — parses uploaded file, maps columns to product schema, resolves parent core
  and recommendation references by Name or SKU, merges with existing catalog (update by ID/SKU, insert new).
- **FR-PROD-6:** Bulk-add modal — inline spreadsheet-style table to add multiple products at once before
  committing to the database.
- **FR-PROD-7:** Duplicate product action — clones a product with "Copy of" prefix for fast catalog expansion.
- **FR-PROD-8:** Reset Catalog — reverts to default seed data after a confirmation dialog.

---

#### 7.5 Quote Builder

- **FR-QUOTE-1:** Quote header inputs: Client Name (required), Effective Date, Membership Count,
  Term Length (months), Annual Uplift % (for multi-year escalation).
- **FR-QUOTE-2:** Product Line selector — toggle pills to include/exclude lines from the quote.
  Only selected lines render their product sections.
- **FR-QUOTE-3:** **Smart Bundling** — selecting a Core product creates a "Configuration Bundle" panel.
  All Child products with a `compatibleCoreIds` reference to that Core appear grouped within the bundle.
  Children without an active parent Core are hidden from the quote entirely.
- **FR-QUOTE-4:** **Volume Inheritance** — Child products default their quantity/volume to their parent
  Core's value. Overridable per line item.
- **FR-QUOTE-5:** **Recommendation Engine:**
  - Selecting a product automatically selects all products in its `recommendedProductIds` array (recursive chain).
  - Deselecting a product cascades removal of its recommendations unless another currently-selected product
    also recommends them (protected dependency check).
- **FR-QUOTE-6:** **Pricing model support:**
  - `PMPM` — price per member per month × membership count × term months
  - `Flat Fee` — fixed price × quantity
  - `Monthly Fee` — fixed recurring fee × term months
  - `Per Unit / Transaction` — price per unit × annual quantity ÷ 12 × term months
  - `Per User / License` — price per seat × seats × term months
  - `Hourly / T&M` — hourly rate × estimated hours
- **FR-QUOTE-7:** **Pricing strategy support:**
  - `Standard` — uses `basePrice` directly.
  - `Tiered` — finds the highest tier `min` ≤ input volume; uses that tier's price. For PMPM Tiered,
    tier price = total monthly fee; effective PMPM = total fee ÷ membership count.
  - `Volume Bands` — membership count falls into one of the configured named bands; uses that band's
    price and impl fee. Child with `inheritTierVolumesFromCore` uses the parent Core's resolved band index.
- **FR-QUOTE-8:** **Baseline Product handling** — for each active Product Line, if a product flagged
  `isBaselineProduct` is present in the catalog, its PMPM and implementation fee are applied once to the
  quote when any product in that line is selected, regardless of how many products are chosen. Displayed
  as a distinct line item in the quote summary.
- **FR-QUOTE-9:** **Scope-based pricing handling** — line items with `Scope-Based Pricing: All` display
  a "Requires Scope Review" badge and are excluded from TCV totals. Items with `Implementation Only` show
  known PMPM/monthly costs in the totals but flag the implementation fee as TBD. The quote summary shows
  a callout listing how many items require pricing review.
- **FR-QUOTE-10:** **Line-item adjustments** — per product, apply a Discount (−) or Uplift (+) as either
  a percentage or flat dollar amount. Strikethrough list price shown alongside adjusted effective price.
  Cannot be applied to scope-based items.
- **FR-QUOTE-11:** **Global quote adjustment** — discount or surcharge applied to Gross TCV after all
  line-item calculations.
- **FR-QUOTE-12:** **Real-time financial summary** (sticky sidebar):
  - PMPM (total per-member-per-month rate)
  - Monthly Fees (flat recurring monthly costs)
  - Monthly Total (PMPM × members + Monthly Fees)
  - ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue = Monthly Total × 12)
  - Implementation Cost (known; TBD items flagged separately)
  - Gross TCV
  - Global Adjustment amount
  - **Net TCV**
  - Scope-review callout (count of items requiring pricing review)
- **FR-QUOTE-13:** **Multi-Year Forecast table** (visible when Term Length > 12 months):
  - Rows: Year 1, Year 2, … Year N
  - Revenue per year with annual uplift applied to recurring items
  - One-time fees attributed to Year 1 only
- **FR-QUOTE-14:** Export quote to CSV.
- **FR-QUOTE-15:** Save quote (creates a record in MongoDB with the current user as owner).
  Load a previously saved quote by ID via URL parameter.
- **FR-QUOTE-16:** Copy/duplicate an existing quote to use as a starting point for a new one.

---

#### 7.6 Quote History Dashboard

- **FR-DASH-1:** Table of quotes scoped by role: Sales Reps see own quotes; Managers see team quotes;
  Execs and Admins see all.
- **FR-DASH-2:** Table columns: Client Name, Created Date, Product Lines (badges), Members, Net TCV,
  Status, Actions (Open, Copy, Delete).
- **FR-DASH-3:** Summary stats cards: Total Quotes, Total Pipeline (Net TCV sum), Quotes by Product
  Line (bar chart).
- **FR-DASH-4:** Filter/search by client name, date range, status, or product line.

---

#### 7.7 User Management (Admin)

- **FR-USER-1:** Admin page listing all users with columns: Name, Email, Role, Status (Active/Inactive),
  Last Login.
- **FR-USER-2:** Admin can change a user's role and activate/deactivate accounts.
- **FR-USER-3:** Invite a new user by email — sends a registration link with a time-limited token.

---

### Phase 2 — Deal Governance & Profitability

**Goal:** Discount controls, approval workflows, and real-time margin intelligence.

---

#### 7.8 Discounting Engine & Approval Workflows

- **FR-DISC-1:** Admin configures **Discount Thresholds** in Settings — e.g., line-item discount > 10%
  triggers Manager Review; > 25% triggers Executive Review.
- **FR-DISC-2:** **Volume Discounts** — admin can define automatic % discounts that apply when total
  membership crosses configured thresholds (distinct from line-item adjustments).
- **FR-DISC-3:** **Quote Status lifecycle:** `Draft` → `Submitted` → `Approved` / `Rejected`. Submitting
  a quote that exceeds a discount threshold automatically routes it to the appropriate approver tier.
- **FR-DISC-4:** Managers and Executives see a dedicated **Approval Queue** — pending quotes with quote
  details, margin score, discount summary, and Approve / Reject + comment actions.
- **FR-DISC-5:** Email notifications sent to the approver on submission; to the Sales Rep on approval or
  rejection (with comment).

---

#### 7.9 Margin Scoring & Profitability

- **FR-MARGIN-1:** Blended Margin calculated per quote in real time:
  - **Total Revenue** = sum of all effective extended prices + one-time fees (after line-item adjustments,
    before global adjustment; excludes scope-based items)
  - **Total Cost** = sum of (`unitCost × quantity`) for all line items
  - **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue − Total Cost
  - **Margin %** = (Gross Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100
- **FR-MARGIN-2:** Admin configures a **Margin Scorecard** in Settings — global thresholds and optional
  per-product-line overrides:

  ```text
  Global:     green ≥ 50%,  yellow ≥ 30%
  Per line:   { "Navigate": { green: 60%, yellow: 40% }, ... }
  ```

- **FR-MARGIN-3:** **Traffic Light badge** displayed in the Quote Summary sidebar:
  - Green (≥ green threshold) → Auto-Approve
  - Yellow (≥ yellow, < green) → Manager Review
  - Red (< yellow) → Executive Review
- **FR-MARGIN-4:** Margin status contributes alongside discount thresholds to determine the approval
  routing tier (the higher tier wins).

---

### Phase 3 — Salesforce Integration & Proposal Generation

**Goal:** Close-loop CRM connectivity and polished client-facing proposal output.

---

#### 7.10 Salesforce Integration

- **FR-SF-1:** Admin settings page for Salesforce connection: Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Instance
  URL, field mapping configuration.
- **FR-SF-2:** **Opportunity Pull** — when creating a quote, Sales Rep can search and link a Salesforce
  Opportunity; pre-populates Client Name (Account Name), Opportunity Type, Close Date.
- **FR-SF-3:** **Intelligent Defaulting** — admin can map Salesforce Opportunity Type (or custom fields)
  to auto-activate specific product lines or pre-select core products in the Quote Builder.
- **FR-SF-4:** **Quote Writeback** — "Save to Salesforce" action on a finalized/approved quote pushes
  to the linked Opportunity: Net TCV, MRR, ARR, line items as Opportunity Products, and attaches the
  generated PDF.
- **FR-SF-5:** **Pricebook Sync** — admin can trigger a one-way sync from Salesforce Pricebooks into
  the CPQ product catalog, matching entries by SKU.

---

#### 7.11 Proposal Generation

- **FR-PROP-1:** "Generate Proposal" action available on Approved quotes — produces a styled PDF using
  `@react-pdf/renderer`.
- **FR-PROP-2:** PDF template includes: company logo and brand colors, client name, effective date,
  prepared-by (Sales Rep name), product line sections with descriptions and pricing tables, TCV/MRR/ARR
  summary, multi-year forecast (if applicable), signature block.
- **FR-PROP-3:** Admin can configure which sections appear in the proposal template (toggles in Settings).
- **FR-PROP-4:** Generated PDF is stored against the Quote record and available for download at any time.
  Optionally pushed to Salesforce as an attachment when using quote writeback.

---

#### 7.12 Modern UI Design System

A cross-cutting design-system layer that adds design tokens, typography, component polish, Bootstrap
Icons, glassmorphism surfaces, a persistent sidebar navigation, and a dark-mode toggle on top of the
existing Bootstrap 5 dependency without replacing it or introducing a CSS preprocessor.

- **FR-UIDS-1:** The application shall define all design tokens (typography, spacing, shadow, border
  radius) as CSS custom properties in a single `frontend/src/styles/theme.css` file imported after
  Bootstrap. No color values shall be hardcoded in any JSX file.

- **FR-UIDS-2:** The font pairing **Inter** (body) and **Plus Jakarta Sans** (headings) shall be
  applied globally via `<link>` preconnect + stylesheet in `index.html` using `font-display: swap`
  to prevent layout shift.

- **FR-UIDS-3:** `bootstrap-icons` shall be installed as an npm package. Every button in the
  application shall carry a Bootstrap Icon paired with a visible text label. Standalone icon-only
  controls (e.g. dark mode toggle) shall carry `aria-label` in lieu of visible text.

- **FR-UIDS-4:** Cards, buttons, tables, forms, and the navbar shall receive polished visual
  treatment (consistent border radius, subtle drop shadows, refined hover states) via `theme.css`
  overrides, without modifying component logic.

- **FR-UIDS-5:** A dark-mode toggle shall be present in the sidebar (desktop) and offcanvas menu
  (mobile) for all user roles. Activating the toggle shall switch the root `data-bs-theme` attribute
  between `"light"` and `"dark"`. The toggle shall carry `aria-label="Toggle dark mode"` and
  `aria-pressed` reflecting the current state.

- **FR-UIDS-6:** The dark-mode preference shall be persisted to `localStorage` under the key
  `cpq-theme` and restored on page load. No database persistence is required.

- **FR-UIDS-7:** All UI elements introduced or modified by this feature shall pass WCAG 2.1 AA
  contrast ratios (≥ 4.5:1 for normal text, ≥ 3:1 for large text and UI components) in both light
  and dark modes. (Extends NFR-7 in Section 6.)

- **FR-UIDS-8:** The existing `BrandingContext` dynamic injection of `--bs-primary` and
  `--bs-secondary` shall continue to function; `theme.css` shall not override these variables
  destructively.

- **FR-UIDS-9:** The application shall apply glassmorphism surface effects (`backdrop-filter: blur()`
  - semi-transparent background) to the sidebar, offcanvas drawer, and modal headers via a
    `.cpq-glass` utility class. An `@supports` CSS block shall provide a solid-background fallback for
    browsers that do not support `backdrop-filter`.

- **FR-UIDS-10:** `Layout.jsx` shall be restructured to present a persistent left sidebar navigation
  at the Bootstrap `md` breakpoint and above. Below `md`, the sidebar shall collapse and be
  accessible via an offcanvas hamburger menu. The sidebar shall display the brand name, all
  role-gated navigation links (each with Bootstrap Icon + text label), and the dark-mode toggle.
  The active route shall be indicated via `aria-current="page"` and a distinct visual style.

#### New Dependencies — 7.12

| Package           | Purpose                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `bootstrap-icons` | Icon set; imported via CSS font file |

#### 7.13 Contextual Tooltips

Adds a reusable `FieldHelp` component that renders an ℹ icon next to form field labels; hovering,
focusing, or tapping the icon displays a plain-text Bootstrap 5 tooltip explaining the field's
purpose and business significance. Establishes a tooltip convention all future phases must follow.

- **FR-TTIP-1:** Every form input in the application whose purpose or business impact is not
  immediately obvious must display a `FieldHelp` icon (`bi-info-circle`) immediately after its
  `<label>` text.

- **FR-TTIP-2:** The tooltip component must be activated by: mouse hover over the icon, keyboard
  focus on the icon (via Tab), and touch tap on mobile devices.

- **FR-TTIP-3:** The tooltip must be dismissible via: mouse-out, blur (keyboard), Escape key,
  and second tap on mobile.

- **FR-TTIP-4:** The tooltip trigger must be a `<button type="button">` element with
  `aria-label="Help"` and `role="tooltip"` on the tooltip content container, linked via
  `aria-describedby`, to meet WCAG 2.1 AA (Success Criteria 1.3.1, 4.1.2).

- **FR-TTIP-5:** All tooltip text must be defined in a single central registry file
  (`frontend/src/utils/tooltips.js`) exported as a `TOOLTIPS` object with namespaced sub-objects
  per domain (e.g. `TOOLTIPS.quoteBuilder`, `TOOLTIPS.products`). No tooltip string may appear
  inline in a component or page. Content must be plain text only (no HTML, images, or rich media).
  The registry is not configurable via the Settings UI.

- **FR-TTIP-6:** The implementation must use Bootstrap 5's built-in `Tooltip` JavaScript module
  (already a project dependency). No additional npm packages may be added.

- **FR-TTIP-7:** A tooltip convention document (`docs/TOOLTIP_CONVENTION.md`) must be created
  and maintained, specifying the rule for when a `FieldHelp` is required and how to add one.

- **FR-TTIP-8:** Tooltip coverage is required on, at minimum, the following fields:
  - **Quote Builder:** `clientName`, `effectiveDate`, `membershipCount`, `termLength`,
    `annualUplift`, `adjustmentDirection`, `adjustmentType`, `adjustmentValue`
  - **Product Catalog:** `sku`, `productLineId`, `type`, `pricingModel`, `pricingStrategy`,
    `billingType`, `basePrice`, `unitCost`, `implementationFee`, `overagePrice`,
    `isBaselineProduct`, `isQuantityBased`, `inheritTierVolumesFromCore`, `tiers[]`,
    `volumeBands[]`, `compatibleCoreIds`, `recommendedProductIds`
  - **Settings:** `companyName`, `logoUrl`, `managerReviewPercent`, `executiveReviewPercent`,
    margin `global.green`, margin `global.yellow`
  - **Product Lines:** `name`, `displayColor`
  - **Users:** `inviteEmail`, `inviteRole`

- **FR-TTIP-9:** All new fields introduced in Phase 2 and Phase 3 must follow the same
  tooltip convention; the convention document must be consulted when implementing any new form field.
